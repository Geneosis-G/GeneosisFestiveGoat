[quote=About this mod]That mod was waithing for a long time now as I abandoned it because it was not working as I expected... But I decided to put some more work into it and I finally managed to have it working :p
So here they are: placable fireworks! ^^ I also added a few more features compared to regular fireworks: my fireworks can also stick to ragdolls, and to moving objects :)
